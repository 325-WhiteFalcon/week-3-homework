		<p>I've been to more countries than most Americans.  While I did go on Uncle Sam's dime to a few cool places around the world, most of my personal trips were to European cities. I've been attracted to European cities mostly because I was born in Germany and I'm in love with the "Old World Culture".  Specifically, I stand in awe of the Churches that are ubiquitous throughout Europe.  Not just the large and imposing churches that took hundereds of years to build, but the small ones that are in small neighborhoods in large cities. I'm not a religious person, but no one cannot argue about the enormous effort it took erect these monuments</P>
